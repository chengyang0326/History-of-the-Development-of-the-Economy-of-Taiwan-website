            The first policy was the “Rice-Fertilizer Barter Program”. This
            policy was “exchanging rice for fertilizer”. Farmers could not buy
            any fertilizer themselves; instead, the government controlled 100%
            of the fertilizer; The only source of fertilizer was the government.
            The exchange rate was 1.5 kg fertilizer: 1 kg rice.
          </p>
          <p>
            By implementing this policy, the government achieved some positive
            results. According to Taiwan Encyclopedia, the following points are
            the results. 1. The government reduced the income of farmers, and
            since the income in this industry was relatively high, farmers in
            rural areas, women at home came to factories. It increased the labor
            supply. 2. By doing this, the government controlled the rice in the
            market, so they were able to control the price of rice and lower it.
            The price of rice was more stable. 3. The government bought rice at
            a lower price, and then they used this money to pay government
            workers, teachers, and soldiers.

              The ROC government set up many protective measures for Taiwan's
              "immature industries" so that Taiwan could develop products with
              low technology requirements, low investment, high labor, and
              national needs. 1. Restrict imports of food, soap, clothing, and
              other items. 2. Raise import tariffs. 3. Lower export tariffs. The
              purpose of all these policies was to encourage "light industries"
              to produce for Taiwan's needs. According to the Taiwan
              Encyclopedia, by 1954, there were no textile imports, and by 1957,
              the cement industry's production was high enough to stop importing
              any cement.
            </p>
            <p class="right">
              After "import substitution", there are many reasons to carry out
              the next development. According to the Encyclopedia of Taiwan,
              because agricultural production technology has made great
              progress, there are more than one million people in the farms who
              need to work. In addition, since 1958, because the demand within
              Taiwan is too small and the output of factories exceeds the
              demand, they need to sell their products overseas. On the other
              hand, the government also encourages other countries to invest in
              Taiwan. In September 1960, the government announced the
              "Investment Encouragement Ordinance", reduced export tariffs, and
              established export processing zones. This unique area attracted
              investors to come and build factories, and then export products
              all over the world, so this development is called
              "export-oriented". 679/5000 Export processing zones are an
              important development at present. The Taiwanese government set up
              a special zone at the seaport and encouraged investors to build
              factories, thereby reducing export tariffs, lowering rents, etc.
              The Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone is the first zone in the
              world. The products produced in the zone do not need to pay taxes
              before exporting. The great success of Taiwan's Export Processing
              Zone has brought many employment opportunities. Kaohsiung has
              become the second largest city in Taiwan today. The Port of
              Kaohsiung is also the largest port in Taiwan.
