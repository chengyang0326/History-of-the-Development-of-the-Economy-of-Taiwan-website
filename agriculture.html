          <h2>375 Rent Reduction</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The first land policy was "375 Rent Reduction" When Taiwan was under
            Japanese rule, due to the overpopulation, landlords with large
            amounts of land could decide who could rent the land (demand was
            high, but the land belonged to a small group of people). Tenants had
            to hand over all crops to the tenants, except for the seed portion.
            When a natural disaster or crop failure occurred, they still needed
            to pay all rent to the landlord. In the past, rent was called "iron
            rent", which meant that their rights were not protected, and even if
            they did not have enough rights, they still needed to give up
            everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first land policy is to change this situation. The government of
            the Republic of China used to implement a 50% rent policy in China,
            which means that the rent cannot be higher than 50% of the crops. In
            April 1949, Chen Cheng, the president of Taiwan Province, announced
            a new land policy "Law to Reduce the Rent of Cultivated Land by
            37.5%". It reduced the rent of 50% by 25%, resulting in the
            following formula:
          </p>
          <p class="special">50% x (1-0.25) = 37.5%</p>

          <ol style="margin-left: 1rem">
            <li>
              Owners are not allowed to advance land rent. If the crops fail,
              then the rent should be lower.
            </li>
            <li>The rental contract should be for no less than six years.</li>
            <li>
              When the contract expires, if the landlord does not intend to take
              it back for self-cultivation, he should rent it to the tenant.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the landlord plans to sell the land, the tenant has first
              priority to purchase it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every town needs to have a rent association to deal with land
              disputes or disputes.

          <h2>Public Land Release</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The following policy is "selling public land". According to the
            Taiwan National Development Council, public land in Taiwan is land
            owned by the Japanese government, private companies and individuals.
            The land area is about 1,760 square kilometers. From 1951 to 1976,
            the government of the Republic of China conducted 9 sales of public
            land transactions. The price of the land was 2.5 times the annual
            rice production of the land. People had to pay the price through
            crops or cash for ten years. The purpose of this policy is to make
            people self-sufficient. This policy benefited 288,627 households,
            and the land sold was 1,397,570,000 square meters.

          <h2>Land cultivation plan</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            In 1953, two years after the "sale of public land", the Republic of
            China government announced a new land policy, the "land cultivation
            procedure". This policy allowed landlords to keep only a portion of
            their land, which the government then took away and distributed to
            people. Landlords received some compensation from the government,
            including stocks in companies owned by the government.
