          Taiwan is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, different groups of
          people live on this island, including Fujian, Hakka, Chinese from
          other provinces, Taiwanese aborigines, and Southeast Asian immigrants.
          Before World War II, Taiwan was a colony of Japan. In 1895, due to the
          failure of the First Anti-Japanese War, China gave Taiwan, the
          Liaodong Peninsula, and other places to Japan. After World War II, the
          government of the Republic of China moved to Taiwan and began to build
          the island. When the government of the Republic of China arrived in
          Taiwan in 1949, Nearly 2 million soldiers and their families also
          moved to Taiwan. When the government of the Republic of China arrived
          in Taiwan at that time, there were many things to be solved. When
          World War II ended in 1945, Taiwan's economic and sanitary conditions
          were very low. The Republic of China government had a major impact on
          Taiwan's development, transforming the economy from an agricultural
          entity to a high-tech industry. During the 1960s to 1980s, a series of
          serious new policies and development plans industrialized Taiwan. The
          National Bureau of Statistics of Taiwan stated that in 1965, the GDP
          per capita was US$229, and 30 years later, in 1984, the GDP per capita
          increased to US$3,225.

          When the R.O.C. government arrived in Taiwan, the first thing they did
          was a series of land policies. First, they amended the law to reduce
          the connection with the Chinese law system, and then issued the Taiwan
          dollar. After that, they established many rules for farmers so that
          they could be self-sufficient. The second step to improve the economic
          situation was to develop "light industry". The government began to
          help build small factories to produce textiles, shoes and paper. This
          helped Taiwan prepare to move to "heavy industry". To stimulate
          investment, the government encouraged investors from all over the
          world to build factories in Taiwan ports. This time is the third step
          of development. This website will discuss what happened in Taiwan, the
          policies and changes in Taiwan and who came to help and make all of
          these things work.

          China, and the aborigines on the island are considered to be the
          origin of the Austronesian people of the Pacific Islands. Taiwan's
          land area is 13,972 kilometers, and there are about 23.8 million
